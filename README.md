![## Features](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/668cadd3c6f16fbdfd59f5cd6eee30534898c26b.png)
### 🌋 **Lava Rising System**

Lava starts rising after a defined countdown and increases by one layer with each rise. The rising speed is fully configurable via the config. The lava level automatically determines when PvP is enabled and when the world border begins to shrink. Thanks to the chunk cache + pipeline method, the system runs smoothly and stably.

### 🎮 **Mod (GameModes) System**

Each game mode has its own item sets, enchantments, countdown duration, GUI slot, and a unique placeholder tag. Users can create unlimited modes via the config. The selected mode defines the game’s pace, equipment, and overall match duration.

### 🧭 **Voting Menu**

Players automatically receive a compass upon joining and can vote for a game mode through a modern MiniMessage-based GUI interface. Each mode displays its description and live vote count. If the votes are tied, the system automatically makes a random selection.

### 🗺️ **Safe Biome Detection**

The system never starts the game in unbalanced areas such as oceans, rivers, or frozen biomes. Using a spiral scanning algorithm, the most suitable biome center is found and the world border is set accordingly. No unnecessary chunk loading is performed.

### ⚔️ **PvP & World Border Management**

PvP is disabled at the start of the game and is automatically enabled once the lava reaches a defined height. The world border shrinks at critical moments during the match. If spectator players move outside the border, they are teleported back to a safe location.

### 📊 **SQL-Based Statistics System**

Works with SQLite or MySQL. Each player's kills, deaths, wins, and matches played are saved asynchronously. Thanks to its cache-based structure, it causes no lag and automatically synchronizes every 2 minutes.

### ⚡ **AutoStart System**

When the required player count is reached, an automatic countdown begins and all players are notified via the Action Bar. If the player count drops, the countdown is instantly cancelled.

### 🔨 **AutoPickup & AutoSmelt**

This config-controlled fast-loot system allows ores to be automatically smelted or collected in their raw form. Players can continue playing without slowing down.

### 🎨 **MiniMessage-Based Modern Notifications**

All titles, action bars, and GUI contents operate using the MiniMessage format. Templates are fully customizable, and every notification is specially designed for high visibility.

### 💰 **Reward System (Kill / Win / Death)**

KteRising includes a fully configurable reward system that allows server owners to execute custom commands based on player actions.

Rewards can be assigned for:
- ✅ Killing another player
- 🏆 Winning the match
- ☠️ Player death

### **👥 Team System (Coming Soon)**

A full team system is currently under development. Players will be able to create or join teams, cooperate strategically, and compete in organized group-based gameplay modes. This feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing game flow.
